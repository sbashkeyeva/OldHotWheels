Project name: HavchikDelivery

All people need a food, u know.
Soooo..
There are some sitiuations in daily life when u have nothing to eat at home. 
We aim to solve this problem by custom delivering of havchik from nearest restaurants or food courts.
Our program can find list of places where delivery system is enabled.
Each consumer can decide type of food to eat starting from fast food ending with alchohol.
